Public health engineers are public health professionals that work to maintain and manage a healthy environment within the community. Through the design of systems and development of policies and procedures to help prevent injury and sickness, public health engineers are on the job when it comes to protecting and promoting health.
 
A public health engineer often collects and reviews data, lab reports, and input from other agencies to enhance health and safety. They often evaluate sanitation conditions in places such as hotels, restaurants, parks and other meeting places. Healthy air and water conditions are also monitored by public health engineers.
 
Public health engineers work in a wide range of organizations and always are working to solve problems to promote and protect the health of the community, which includes people, animals, and the environment. Public health engineers work in many different industries, including universities, laboratories, utility companies, refineries, manufacturing companies, and government agencies. Some experienced public health engineers become consultants, assisting private industries and government agencies by helping them to manage their programs and facilities.
 
Public health engineers can have a wide range of tasks and projects they are working on. Often, they will be visiting different locations and facilities performing inspections to ensure that both local and federal health and safety standards are met. These public health professionals also keep an eye out for problem areas that could be improved to further ensure health and safety.
 
Public health engineers also create reports and work to develop systems for improving public health and reduce public health risks. Enforcing local, state, and federal public health regulations that relate to public water supply systems, waste disposal, sewage, water treatment, and more come under their domain. They may even find themselves with government officials, working together to improve public health by reducing health and safety risks.
 
Commonly, those aspiring to public health engineering study public health or environmental engineering. These programs will offer the standard courses that ensure knowledge in the areas that public health engineers must be well-versed in. Courses will include classes in engineering drawing, mechanics, materials, and engineering fundamental theories, as well as geology, civil or electrical engineering, and surveying. Students can expect an introduction to fluid, soil, and solid mechanics. Bring your calculator to learn calculus, analytical geometry, and other advanced math classes. Students enjoy electives in such subjects as structural analysis, hydrology, transportation engineering, and project management.
 
In addition to traditional classroom experiences, some programs require internships or other experiences outside of the classroom. These are opportunities for students to investigate areas of their interest and network, giving direction to future aspirations.
 
Clients and employers recognize the PE credentials and the effort in education and work experience required to earn it. Employers know they can trust the ability and skill of a PE, and they know a PE can take responsibilities that could take them to higher levels of work.
 
While some people focus on becoming a public health engineer from the beginning, it is not unusual to enter the field less directly. Some find that experience from other jobs will help them to become a public health engineer. Some public health engineering jobs actually require experience in other roles, such as project engineering. It is not uncommon for public health engineers to have previous employment experience as engineers or project managers prior to entering the field of public health engineering.
 
While, like any career, there are many routine aspects, public health engineers sometimes have to work in challenging situations. Public health engineers should be prepared to work in challenging conditions, which may include working in the field under sometimes difficult social, weather, or environmental circumstances. They may have to deal with poor sanitation conditions, environmental issues like insect and rodent infestation problems, unsafe buildings, and dangerous chemicals, to name a few demanding and less routine situations. Public health engineers have to work with these and more problems in the field, and likely welcome some routine from time to time.
 
Although education and experience go a long way in making someone a successful public health engineer, these professionals often have some personal characteristics in common. Most have very strong problem-solving skills that enable them to troubleshoot and find solutions. Problem-solving skills promise to have a direct impact in their ability to perform well under pressure as a public health engineer.
 
As in many careers, strong communication skills are necessary to perform the job well. Written and oral communication skills enable public health engineers to prepare meaningful reports, speak confidently to groups and individuals, and write succinct emails.
 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS.org), careers that have some similarities to public health engineering include: industrial engineering, fire inspection, mining and geological engineering, occupational health & safety technology, and construction & building inspection.
 
Workplace safety is an important area of public health engineering. Public health engineers develop policies and procedures, and design systems to protect employees from illness, injury, and property damage. They make sure that chemicals, machinery, furniture, computer software, and other things in the workplace do not cause harm.
 
Public health engineers investigate workplace accidents and injuries, determining their cause and whether they could be prevented in the future. In addition, they assess the corrections made to remedy any violations found during health inspections.
 
The median wage is the wage that half the workers in an occupation earned more than and half earned less. The median annual wage for all workers in all occupations in the U.S. in May 2020 was $41,950. The median annual pay for health and safety engineers in May 2020 was $94,240. This is obviously higher than the average for all occupations, but the amount someone is actually paid as a public health engineer depends on their location, education, work experience, special training, and more.
 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS.org), the job outlook for health and safety engineers is average when compared to all other professions, with a four percent increase anticipated from 2019 to 2029.
 
The professional organization for those in the field of public health engineering is the Society of Public Health Engineers. Professionals enjoy the benefits of these organizations for their networking and professional development opportunities, among other things. Other professional organizations that are related to public health engineering are the American Society of Safety Professionals and the National Society for Professional Engineers.

I am honored to serve as the Interim Chair in the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the Gillings School of Global Public Health - the #1 public school of public health in the nation. We are building on our long and strong history within Gillings, with more than 100 years of innovation and impact protecting the environment and supporting healthy communities.
 
If anything, the past decade has shown that stove-piped responses will not deliver the long-term, sustainable results we need. Engineering solutions to household water service provision, for example, must be done within the broader context of a one-health approach to meaningfully reduce water-related diseases. As collaborative environmental scientists and engineers located within the top public school of public health, ESE is ideally positioned to provide holistic, intersectoral responses to mitigate and prepare for the pressing environmental challenges. We do this by characterizing susceptible populations, assessing health risks, creating technological and policy options with co-benefits for health and sustainability, and proactively engaging communities. Thus, we celebrate a century of environmental solutions to public health problems, and we affirm our commitment to build public health resilience to climate and environmental change.
